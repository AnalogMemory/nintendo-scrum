// Global resets to common HTML elements and more for easier usage by Bootstrap.
// Adds additional rules on top of Normalize.css, including several overrides.

// Reset the box-sizing
//
// Change from `box-sizing: content-box` to `border-box` so that when you add
// `padding` or `border`s to an element, the overall declared `width` does not
// change. For example, `width: 100px;` will always be `100px` despite the
// `border: 0.625rem solid red;` and `padding: 1.25rem;`.
//
// Heads up! This reset may cause conflicts with some third-party widgets. For
// recommendations on resolving such conflicts, see
// https://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#third-box-sizing.

// Make viewport responsive
//
// @viewport is needed because IE 10+ doesn't honor <meta name="viewport"> in
// some cases. See https://timkadlec.com/2012/10/ie10-snap-mode-and-responsive-design/.
// Eventually @viewport will replace <meta name="viewport">.
//
// However, `device-width` is broken on IE 10 on Windows (Phone) 8,
// (see https://timkadlec.com/2013/01/windows-phone-8-and-device-width/ and https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/10497)
// and the fix for that involves a snippet of JavaScript to sniff the user agent
// and apply some conditional CSS.
//
// See https://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#support-ie10-width for the relevant hack.
//
// Wrap `@viewport` with `@at-root` for when folks do a nested import (e.g.,
// `.class-name { @import "bootstrap"; }`).
@at-root {
  @-ms-viewport { width: device-width; }
}

  // We assume no initial pixel `font-size` for accessibility reasons. This
  // allows web visitors to customize their browser default font-size, making
  // your project more inclusive and accessible to everyone.

  // As a side-effect of setting the @viewport above,
  // IE11 & Edge make the scrollbar overlap the content and automatically hide itself when not in use.
  // Unfortunately, the auto-showing of the scrollbar is sometimes too sensitive,
  // thus making it hard to click on stuff near the right edge of the page.
  // So we add this style to force IE11 & Edge to use a "normal", non-overlapping, non-auto-hiding scrollbar.
  // See https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/18543
  // and https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/7165383/
